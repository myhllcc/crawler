['\n        Quantum Hall-superconductor heterostructures provide possible platforms for intrinsically fault-tolerant quantum computing. Motivated by several recent experiments that successfully integrated these phases, we investigate transport through a proximitized integer quantum Hall edge--paying particular attention to the impact of vortices in the superconductor. By examining the downstream conductance, we identify regimes in which sub-gap vortex levels mediate Andreev processes that would otherwise be frozen out in a vortex-free setup. Moreover, we show that at finite temperature, and in the limit of a large number of vortices, the downstream conductance can average to zero, indicating that the superconductor effectively behaves like a normal contact. Our results highlight the importance of considering vortices when using transport measurements to study superconducting correlations in quantum Hall-superconductor hybrids.\n        '
 '\n        Motivated by recent experiments on low-carrier-density superconductors, including twisted multilayer graphene, we study signatures of the BCS to BEC evolution in Andreev reflection spectroscopy. We establish that in a standard quantum point contact geometry, Andreev reflection in a BEC superconductor is unable to mediate a zero-bias conductance beyond $e^2/h$ per lead channel. This bound is shown to result from a duality that links the sub-gap conductance of BCS and BEC superconductors. We then demonstrate that sharp signatures of BEC superconductivity, including perfect Andreev reflection, can be recovered by tunneling through a suitably designed potential well. We propose various tunneling spectroscopy setups to experimentally probe this recovery.\n        '
 '\n        In the presence of a large perpendicular electric field, Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene (BLG) features several broken-symmetry metallic phases as well as magnetic-field-induced superconductivity. The superconducting state is quite fragile, however, appearing only in a narrow window of density and with a maximum critical temperature $T_c\\approx30$~mK. Here, we show that placing monolayer tungsten diselenide (WSe$_{2}$) on BLG promotes Cooper pairing to an extraordinary degree: superconductivity appears at zero magnetic field, exhibits an order of magnitude enhancement in $T_c$, and occurs over a density range that is wider by a factor of eight. By mapping quantum oscillations in BLG-WSe$_2$ as a function of electric field and doping, we establish that superconductivity emerges throughout a region whose normal state is polarized, with two out of four spin-valley flavours predominantly populated. In-plane magnetic field measurements further reveal a striking dependence of the critical field on doping, with the Chandrasekhar-Clogston (Pauli) limit roughly obeyed on one end of the superconducting dome yet sharply violated on the other. Moreover, the superconductivity arises only for perpendicular electric fields that push BLG hole wavefunctions towards WSe$_2$ -- suggesting that proximity-induced (Ising) spin-orbit coupling plays a key role in enhancing the pairing. Our results pave the way for engineering robust, highly tunable, and ultra-clean graphene-based superconductors.\n        '
 "\n        Arrays of Rydberg atoms constitute a highly tunable, strongly interacting venue for the pursuit of exotic states of matter. We develop a new strategy for accessing a family of fractionalized phases known as quantum spin liquids in two-dimensional Rydberg arrays. We specifically use effective field theory methods to study arrays assembled from Rydberg chains tuned to an Ising phase transition that famously hosts emergent fermions propagating within each chain. This highly entangled starting point allows us to naturally access spin liquids familiar from Kitaev's honeycomb model, albeit from an entirely different framework. In particular, we argue that finite-range repulsive Rydberg interactions, which frustrate nearby symmetry-breaking orders, can enable coherent propagation of emergent fermions between the chains in which they were born. Delocalization of emergent fermions across the full two-dimensional Rydberg array yields a gapless Z2 spin liquid with a single massless Dirac cone. Here, the Rydberg occupation numbers exhibit universal power-law correlations that provide a straightforward experimental diagnostic of this phase. We further show that explicitly breaking symmetries perturbs the gapless spin liquid into gapped, topologically ordered descendants: Breaking lattice symmetries generates toric-code topological order, whereas introducing chirality generates non-Abelian Ising topological order. In the toric-code phase, we analytically construct microscopic incarnations of non-Abelian defects, which can be created and transported by dynamically controlling the atom positions in the array. Our work suggests that appropriately tuned Rydberg arrays provide a cold-atoms counterpart of solid-state 'Kitaev materials' and, more generally, spotlights a new angle for pursuing experimental platforms for Abelian and non-Abelian fractionalization.\n        "
 '\n        Graphene moire superlattices have emerged as a platform hosting and abundance of correlated insulating, topological, and superconducting phases. While the origins of strong correlations and non-trivial topology are shown to be directly linked to flat moire bands, the nature and mechanism of superconductivity remain enigmatic. In particular, only alternating twisted stacking geometries of bilayer and trilayer graphene are found to exhibit robust superconductivity manifesting as zero resistance and Fraunhofer interference patterns. Here we demonstrate that magic-angle twisted tri-, quadri-, and pentalayers placed on monolayer tungsten diselenide exhibit flavour polarization and superconductivity. We also observe insulating states in the trilayer and quadrilayer arising at finite electric displacement fields, despite the presence of dispersive bands introduced by additional graphene layers. Moreover, the three multilayer geometries allow us to identify universal features in the family of graphene moire structures arising from the intricate relations between superconducting states, symmetry-breaking transitions, and van Hove singularities. Remarkably, as the number of layers increases, superconductivity emerges over a dramatically enhanced filling-factor range. In particular, in twisted pentalayers, superconductivity extends well beyond the filling of four electrons per moire unit cell, demonstrating the non-trivial role of the additional bands. Our results highlight the importance of the interplay between flat and dispersive bands in extending superconducting regions in graphene moire superlattices and open new frontiers for developing graphene-based superconductors.\n        '
 '\n        Non-Abelian defects that bind Majorana or parafermion zero modes are prominent in several topological quantum computation schemes. Underpinning their established understanding is the quantum Ising spin chain, which can be recast as a fermionic model or viewed as a standalone effective theory for the surface-code edge -- both of which harbor non-Abelian defects. We generalize these notions by deriving an effective Ising-like spin chain describing the edge of quantum-double topological order. Relating Majorana and parafermion modes to anyonic strings, we introduce quantum-double generalizations of non-Abelian defects. We develop a way to embed finite-group valued qunits into those valued in continuous groups. Using this embedding, we provide a continuum description of the spin chain and recast its non-interacting part as a quantum wire via addition of a Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten term and non-Abelian bosonization.\n        '
 "\n        Relativistic Mott insulators known as 'Kitaev materials' potentially realize spin liquids hosting non-Abelian anyons. Motivated by fault-tolerant quantum-computing applications in this setting, we introduce a dynamical anyon-generation protocol that exploits universal edge physics. The setup features holes in the spin liquid, which define energetically cheap locations for non-Abelian anyons, connected by a narrow bridge that can be tuned between spin liquid and topologically trivial phases. We show that modulating the bridge from trivial to spin liquid over intermediate time scales -- quantified by analytics and extensive simulations -- deposits non-Abelian anyons into the holes with O(1) probability. The required bridge manipulations can be implemented by integrating the Kitaev material into magnetic tunnel junction arrays that engender locally tunable exchange fields. Combined with existing readout strategies, our protocol reveals a path to topological qubit experiments in Kitaev materials at zero applied magnetic field.\n        "
 '\n        Magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene (MATTG) has emerged as a novel moiré material that exhibits both strong electronic correlations and unconventional superconductivity. However, spectroscopic studies of its electronic properties are lacking, and the nature of superconductivity and the corresponding order parameter in this system remain elusive. Here we perform high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy of MATTG and reveal extensive regions of atomic reconstruction that favor mirror-symmetric stacking. In these regions, we observe a cascade of symmetry-breaking electronic transitions and doping-dependent band structure deformations similar to those realized in magic-angle bilayers, as expected theoretically given the commonality of flat bands. More strikingly, in a density window spanning two to three holes per moire unit cell, spectroscopic signatures of superconductivity are manifest as pronounced dips in the tunneling conductance at the Fermi level accompanied by coherence peaks that become gradually suppressed at elevated temperatures and magnetic fields. The observed evolution of the conductance with doping is consistent with a gate-tunable transition from a gapped to a nodal superconductor, which we show theoretically is compatible with a sharp transition from a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) to a Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) superconductor with a nodal order parameter. Within this doping window, we also detect peak-dip-hump structures suggesting that superconductivity is driven by strong coupling to bosonic modes of MATTG. Our results pave the way for further understanding of superconductivity and correlated states in graphene-based moiré structures beyond twisted bilayers, where unconventional superconductivity and nodal pairing were reported.\n        '
 '\n        Rydberg chains provide an appealing platform for probing conformal field theories (CFTs) that capture universal behavior in a myriad of physical settings. Focusing on a Rydberg chain at the Ising transition separating charge density wave and disordered phases, we establish a detailed link between microscopics and low-energy physics emerging at criticality. We first construct lattice incarnations of primary fields in the underlying Ising CFT including chiral fermions -- a nontrivial task given that the Rydberg chain Hamiltonian does not admit an exact fermionization. With this dictionary in hand, we compute correlations of microscopic Rydberg operators, paying special attention to finite, open chains of immediate experimental relevance. We further develop a method to quantify how second-neighbor Rydberg interactions tune the sign and strength of four-fermion couplings in the Ising CFT. Finally, we determine how the Ising fields evolve when four-fermion couplings drive an instability to Ising tricriticality. Our results pave the way to a thorough experimental characterization of Ising criticality in Rydberg arrays, and can inform the design of novel higher-dimensional phases based on coupled critical chains.\n        '
 '\n        Recent theoretical studies inspired by experiments on the Kitaev magnet $α$-RuCl$_3$ highlight the nontrivial impact of phonons on the thermal Hall conductivity of chiral topological phases. Here we introduce mixed mesoscopic-macroscopic devices that allow refined thermal-transport probes of non-Abelian spin liquids with Ising topological order. These devices feature a quantum-coherent mesoscopic region with negligible phonon conductance, flanked by macroscopic lobes that facilitate efficient thermalization between chiral Majorana edge modes and bulk phonons. We show that our devices enable $(i)$ accurate determination of the quantized thermal Hall conductivity, $(ii)$ identification of non-Abelian Ising anyons via the temperature dependence of the thermal conductance, and most interestingly $(iii)$ single-anyon detection through heat-based anyon interferometry. Analogous results apply broadly to phonon-coupled chiral topological orders.\n        '
 "\n        Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) realizes a highly tunable, strongly interacting system featuring superconductivity and various correlated insulating states. We establish gate-defined wires in TBG with proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling as $(i)$ a tool for revealing the nature of correlated insulators and $(ii)$ a platform for Majorana-based topological qubits. In particular, we show that the band structure of a gate-defined wire immersed in an `inter-valley coherent' correlated insulator inherits electrically detectable fingerprints of symmetry breaking native to the latter. Surrounding the wire by a superconducting TBG region on one side and an inter-valley coherent correlated insulator on the other further enables the formation of Majorana zero modes--possibly even at zero magnetic field depending on the precise symmetry-breaking order present. Our proposal not only introduces a highly gate-tunable topological qubit medium relying on internally generated proximity effects, but can also shed light on the Cooper-pairing mechanism in TBG.\n        "
 '\n        Flat electronic bands, characteristic of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (TBG), host a wealth of correlated phenomena. Early theoretical considerations suggested that, at the magic angle, the Dirac velocity vanishes and the entire width of the moiré bands becomes extremely narrow. Yet, this scenario contradicts experimental studies that reveal a finite Dirac velocity as well as bandwidths significantly larger than predicted. Here we use spatially resolved spectroscopy in finite and zero magnetic fields to examine the electronic structure of moiré bands and their intricate connection to correlated phases. By following the relative shifts of Landau levels in finite fields, we detect filling-dependent band flattening, that unexpectedly starts already at ~1.3 degrees, well above the magic angle and hence nominally in the weakly correlated regime. We further show that, as the twist angle is reduced, the moiré bands become maximally flat at progressively lower doping levels. Surprisingly, when the twist angles reach values for which the maximal flattening occurs at approximate filling of $-2$, $+1$,$+2$,$+3$ electrons per moiré unit cell, the corresponding zero-field correlated phases start to emerge. Our observations are corroborated by calculations that incorporate an interplay between the Coulomb charging energy and exchange interactions; together these effects produce band flattening and hence a significant density-of-states enhancement that facilitates the observed symmetry-breaking cascade transitions. Besides emerging phases pinned to integer fillings, we also experimentally identify a series of pronounced correlation-driven band deformations and soft gaps in a wider doping range around $\\pm 2$ filling where superconductivity is expected. Our results highlight the role of interaction-driven band-flattening in forming robust correlated phases in TBG.\n        '
 "\n        We study semiconductor nanowires coupled to a bilayer of a disordered superconductor and a magnetic insulator, motivated by recent experiments reporting possible Majorana-zero-mode signatures in related architectures. Specifically, we pursue a quasiclassical Usadel equation approach that treats superconductivity in the bilayer self-consistently in the presence of spin-orbit scattering, magnetic-impurity scattering, and Zeeman splitting induced by both the magnetic insulator and a supplemental applied field. Within this framework we explore prospects for engineering topological superconductivity in a nanowire proximate to the bilayer. We find that a magnetic-insulator-induced Zeeman splitting, mediated through the superconductor alone, cannot induce a topological phase since the destruction of superconductivity (i.e., Clogston limit) preempts the required regime in which the nanowire's Zeeman energy exceeds the induced pairing strength. However, this Zeeman splitting does reduce the critical applied field needed to access the topological phase transition, with fields antiparallel to the magnetization of the magnetic insulator having an optimal effect. Finally, we show that magnetic-impurity scattering degrades the topological phase, and spin-orbit scattering, if present in the superconductor, pushes the Clogston limit to higher fields yet simultaneously increases the critical applied field strength.\n        "
 "\n        Motivated by recent experiments on the Kitaev honeycomb magnet $α\\text{-RuCl}_3$, we introduce time-domain probes of the edge and quasiparticle content of non-Abelian spin liquids. Our scheme exploits ancillary quantum spins that communicate via time-dependent tunneling of energy into and out of the spin liquid's chiral Majorana edge state. We show that the ancillary-spin dynamics reveals the edge-state velocity and, in suitable geometries, detects individual non-Abelian anyons and emergent fermions via a time-domain counterpart of quantum-Hall anyon interferometry. We anticipate applications to a wide variety of topological phases in solid-state and cold-atoms settings.\n        "
 "\n        Magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) exhibits a range of correlated phenomena that originate from strong electron-electron interactions. These interactions make the Fermi surface highly susceptible to reconstruction when $ \\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 3$ electrons occupy each moir\\' e unit cell and lead to the formation of correlated insulating, superconducting and ferromagnetic phases. While some phases have been shown to carry a non-zero Chern number, the local microscopic properties and topological character of many other phases remain elusive. Here we introduce a set of novel techniques hinging on scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) to map out topological phases in MATBG that emerge in finite magnetic field. By following the evolution of the local density of states (LDOS) at the Fermi level with electrostatic doping and magnetic field, we visualize a local Landau fan diagram that enables us to directly assign Chern numbers to all observed phases. We uncover the existence of six topological phases emanating from integer fillings in finite fields and whose origin relates to a cascade of symmetry-breaking transitions driven by correlations. The spatially resolved and electron-density-tuned LDOS maps further reveal that these topological phases can form only in a small range of twist angles around the magic-angle value. Both the microscopic origin and extreme sensitivity to twist angle differentiate these topological phases from the Landau levels observed near charge neutrality. Moreover, we observe that even the charge-neutrality Landau spectrum taken at low fields is considerably modified by interactions and exhibits an unexpected splitting between zero Landau levels that can be as large as ${\\sim }\\,3-5$ meV. Our results show how strong electronic interactions affect the band structure of MATBG and lead to the formation of correlation-enabled topological phases.\n        "
 "\n        Time-reversal-invariant topological superconductor (TRITOPS) wires host Majorana Kramers pairs that have been predicted to mediate a fractional Josephson effect with $4π$ periodicity in the superconducting phase difference. We explore the TRITOPS fractional Josephson effect in the presence of time-dependent `local mixing' perturbations that instantaneously preserve time-reversal symmetry. Specifically, we show that just as such couplings render braiding of Majorana Kramers pairs non-universal, the Josephson current becomes either aperiodic or $2π$-periodic (depending on conditions that we quantify) unless the phase difference is swept sufficiently quickly. We further analyze topological superconductors with $\\mathcal{T}^2 = +1$ time-reversal symmetry and reveal a rich interplay between interactions and local mixing that can be experimentally probed in nanowire arrays.\n        "
 '\n        Magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (TBG), with rotational misalignment close to 1.1$^\\circ$, features isolated flat electronic bands that host a rich phase diagram of correlated insulating, superconducting, ferromagnetic, and topological phases. The origins of the correlated insulators and superconductivity, and the interplay between them, are particularly elusive. Both states have been previously observed only for angles within $\\pm0.1^\\circ$ from the magic-angle value and occur in adjacent or overlapping electron density ranges; nevertheless, it is still unclear how the two states are related. Beyond the twist angle and strain, the dependence of the TBG phase diagram on the alignment and thickness of insulating hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) used to encapsulate the graphene sheets indicates the importance of the microscopic dielectric environment. Here we show that adding an insulating tungsten-diselenide (WSe$_2$) monolayer between hBN and TBG stabilizes superconductivity at twist angles much smaller than the established magic-angle value. For the smallest angle of $θ$ = 0.79$^\\circ$, we still observe clear superconducting signatures, despite the complete absence of the correlated insulating states and vanishing gaps between the dispersive and flat bands. These observations demonstrate that, even though electron correlations may be important, superconductivity in TBG can exist even when TBG exhibits metallic behaviour across the whole range of electron density. Finite-magnetic-field measurements further reveal breaking of the four-fold spin-valley symmetry in the system, consistent with large spin-orbit coupling induced in TBG via proximity to WSe$_2$. Our results highlight the importance of symmetry breaking effects in stabilizing electronic states in TBG and open new avenues for engineering quantum phases in moiré systems.\n        '

We specifically introduce circuits that exploit interfaces between electrically active systems and Kitaev materials to `perfectly' convert electrons from the former into emergent fermions in the latter---thereby enabling variations of transport probes invented for topological superconductors and fractional quantum Hall states. Along the way we resolve puzzles in the literature concerning interacting Majorana fermions, and also develop an anyon-interferometry framework that incorporates nontrivial energy-partitioning effects. Our results illuminate a partial pathway towards topological quantum computation with Kitaev materials.\n        "
 "\n        Topological quantum computation encodes quantum information nonlocally by nucleating non-Abelian anyons separated by distances $L$, typically spanning the qubit device size. This nonlocality renders topological qubits exponentially immune to dephasing from all sources of classical noise with operator support local on the scale of $L$. We perform detailed analytical and numerical analyses of a time-domain Ramsey-type protocol for noisy Majorana-based qubits that is designed to validate this coveted topological protection in near-term devices such as the so-called `tetron' design. By assessing dependence of dephasing times on tunable parameters, e.g., magnetic field, our proposed protocol can clearly distinguish a bona fide Majorana qubit from one constructed from semilocal Andreev bound states, which can otherwise closely mimic the true topological scenario in local probes. In addition, we analyze leakage of the qubit out of its low-energy manifold due to classical-noise-induced generation of quasiparticle excitations; leakage limits the qubit lifetime when the bulk gap collapses, and hence our protocol further reveals the onset of a topological phase transition. This experiment requires measurement of two nearby Majorana modes for both initialization and readout---achievable, for example, by tunnel coupling to a nearby quantum dot---but no further Majorana manipulations, and thus constitutes an enticing pre-braiding experiment. Along the way, we address conceptual subtleties encountered when discussing dephasing and leakage in the context of Majorana qubits.\n        "
 "\n        Stacking two graphene layers twisted by the 'magic angle' $θ\\approx 1.1^\\circ$ generates flat energy bands, which in turn catalyzes various strongly correlated phenomena depending on filling and sample details. At charge neutrality, transport measurements reveal superficially mundane semimetallicity (as expected when correlations are weak) in some samples yet robust insulation in others. We propose that the interplay between interactions and disorder admits either behavior, even when the system is strongly correlated and locally gapped. Specifically, we argue that strong interactions supplemented by weak, smooth disorder stabilize a network of gapped quantum valley Hall domains with spatially varying Chern numbers determined by the disorder landscape--even when an entirely different order is favored in the clean limit. Within this scenario, sufficiently small samples that realize a single domain display insulating transport characteristics. Conversely, multi-domain samples exhibit re-emergent massless Dirac fermions formed by gapless domain-wall modes, yielding semimetallic behavior except on the ultra-long scales at which localization becomes visible. We discuss experimental tests of this proposal via local probes and transport. Our results highlight the crucial role that randomness can play in ground-state selection of twisted heterostructures, an observation that we expect to have further ramifications at other fillings.\n        "

Such a phase exhibits a bulk magnetization that returns to its original form after two drive periods, together with Majorana end modes that recover their initial form only after four drive periods. We propose experimental implementations and detection schemes for this new state.\n        '

At half filling of the bands, we observe the development of gaps originating from correlated insulating states. Near charge neutrality, we find a previously unidentified correlated regime featuring a substantially enhanced flat band splitting that we describe within a microscopic model predicting a strong tendency towards nematic ordering.

 "\n        We numerically assess model wave functions for the recently proposed particle-hole-symmetric Pfaffian (`PH-Pfaffian') topological order, a phase consistent with the recently reported thermal Hall conductance [Banerjee et al., Nature 559, 205 (2018)] at the ever enigmatic $ν=5/2$ quantum-Hall plateau. We find that the most natural Moore-Read-inspired trial state for the PH-Pfaffian, when projected into the lowest Landau level, exhibits a remarkable numerical similarity on accessible system sizes with the corresponding (compressible) composite Fermi liquid. Consequently, this PH-Pfaffian trial state performs reasonably well energetically in the half-filled lowest Landau level, but is likely not a good starting point for understanding the $ν=5/2$ ground state. Our results suggest that the PH-Pfaffian model wave function either encodes anomalously weak $p$-wave pairing of composite fermions or fails to represent a gapped, incompressible phase altogether.\n        "
 '\n        We introduce a family of commuting-projector Hamiltonians whose degrees of freedom involve $\\mathbb{Z}_{3}$ parafermion zero modes residing in a parent fractional-quantum-Hall fluid. The two simplest models in this family emerge from dressing Ising-paramagnet and toric-code spin models with parafermions; we study their edge properties, anyonic excitations, and ground-state degeneracy. We show that the first model realizes a symmetry-enriched topological phase (SET) for which $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin-flip symmetry from the Ising paramagnet permutes the anyons. Interestingly, the interface between this SET and the parent quantum-Hall phase realizes symmetry-enforced $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermion criticality with no fine-tuning required. The second model exhibits a non-Abelian phase that is consistent with $\\text{SU}(2)_{4}$ topological order, and can be accessed by gauging the $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ symmetry in the SET. Employing Levin-Wen string-net models with $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-graded structure, we generalize this picture to construct a large class of commuting-projector models for $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ SETs and non-Abelian topological orders exhibiting the same relation.

We further simulate a Rabi-oscillation protocol in a specific qubit design with four Majorana zero modes in a single wire and quantify constraints on the timescales for performing qubit operations in this setup. Our simulations utilize a Majorana representation of the system, which greatly simplifies simulations of superconductors at the mean-field level.\n        '

Specifically, we show that an electric potential fluctuating randomly in time can backscatter electrons inelastically without constraints faced by electron-electron interactions. We quantify noise-induced corrections to the dc conductance in various regimes and propose an experiment to test this scenario.\n        '
 "\n        Parafermion zero modes are generalizations of Majorana modes that underlie comparatively rich non-Abelian-anyon properties. We introduce exact mappings that connect parafermion chains, which can emerge in two-dimensional fractionalized media, to strictly one-dimensional fermionic systems. In particular, we show that parafermion zero modes in the former setting translate into 'symmetry-enriched Majorana modes' that intertwine with a bulk order parameter---yielding braiding and fusion properties that are impossible in standard Majorana platforms. Fusion characteristics of symmetry-enriched Majorana modes are directly inherited from the associated parafermion setup and can be probed via two kinds of anomalous pumping cycles that we construct. Most notably, our mappings relate $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ parafermions to conventional electrons with time-reversal symmetry. In this case, one of our pumping protocols entails fairly minimal experimental requirements: Cycling a weakly correlated wire between a trivial phase and time-reversal-invariant topological superconducting state produces an edge magnetization with quadrupled periodicity.

We determine scaling forms for the conductance through a grounded superconductor and show that the results depend sensitively on the interaction strength in the leads, the size of the superconducting region, and the presence or absence of time-reversal-breaking perturbations. We also study transport across a floating superconducting island isolated by magnetic barriers. Here we predict e-periodic Coulomb-blockade peaks, as recently observed in nanowire devices [Albrecht et al., Nature 531, 206 (2016)], with the added feature that the island can support fractional charge tunable via the relative orientation of the barrier magnetizations. As an interesting corollary, when the magnetic barriers arise from strong interactions at the edge that spontaneously break time-reversal symmetry, the Coulomb-blockade periodicity changes from e to e/2. These findings suggest several future experiments that probe unique characteristics of topological superconductivity at the quantum spin Hall edge.\n        '
 "\n        Dimer models have long been a fruitful playground for understanding topological physics. Here we introduce a new class - termed Majorana-dimer models - wherein bosonic dimers are decorated with pairs of Majorana modes. We find that the simplest examples of such systems realize an intriguing, intrinsically fermionic phase of matter that can be viewed as the product of a chiral Ising theory, which hosts deconfined non-Abelian quasiparticles, and a topological $p_x - ip_y$ superconductor. While the bulk anyons are described by a single copy of the Ising theory, the edge remains fully gapped. Consequently, this phase can arise in exactly solvable, frustration-free models. We describe two parent Hamiltonians: one generalizes the well-known dimer model on the triangular lattice, while the other is most naturally understood as a model of decorated fluctuating loops on a honeycomb lattice. Using modular transformations, we show that the ground-state manifold of the latter model unambiguously exhibits all properties of the $\\text{Ising} \\times (p_x-ip_y)$ theory. We also discuss generalizations with more than one Majorana mode per site, which realize phases related to Kitaev's 16-fold way in a similar fashion.\n        "
 '\n        We introduce a particle-hole-symmetric metallic state of bosons in a magnetic field at odd-integer filling. This state hosts composite fermions whose energy dispersion features a quadratic band touching and corresponding $2π$ Berry flux protected by particle-hole and discrete rotation symmetries. We also construct an alternative particle-hole symmetric state---distinct in the presence of inversion symmetry---without Berry flux. As in the Dirac composite Fermi liquid introduced by Son, breaking particle-hole symmetry recovers the familiar Chern-Simons theory. We discuss realizations of this phase both in 2D and on bosonic topological insulator surfaces, as well as signatures in experiments and simulations.\n        '
 "\n        Recent experiments have produced mounting evidence of Majorana zero modes in nanowire-superconductor hybrids. Signatures of an expected topological phase transition accompanying the onset of these modes nevertheless remain elusive. We investigate a fundamental question concerning this issue: Do well-formed Majorana modes necessarily entail a sharp phase transition in these setups? Assuming reasonable parameters, we argue that finite-size effects can dramatically smooth this putative transition into a crossover, even in systems large enough to support well-localized Majorana modes. We propose overcoming such finite-size effects by examining the behavior of low-lying excited states through tunneling spectroscopy. In particular, the excited-state energies exhibit characteristic field and density dependence, and scaling with system size, that expose an approaching topological phase transition. We suggest several experiments for extracting the predicted behavior. As a useful byproduct, the protocols also allow one to measure the wire's spin-orbit coupling directly in its superconducting environment.\n        "
 "\n        We introduce a scheme for preparation, manipulation, and readout of Majorana zero modes in semiconducting wires with mesoscopic superconducting islands. Our approach synthesizes recent advances in materials growth with tools commonly used in quantum-dot experiments, including gate-control of tunnel barriers and Coulomb effects, charge sensing, and charge pumping. We outline a sequence of milestones interpolating between zero-mode detection and quantum computing that includes (1) detection of fusion rules for non-Abelian anyons using either proximal charge sensors or pumped current; (2) validation of a prototype topological qubit; and (3) demonstration of non-Abelian statistics by braiding in a branched geometry. The first two milestones require only a single wire with two islands, and additionally enable sensitive measurements of the system's excitation gap, quasiparticle poisoning rates, residual Majorana zero-mode splittings, and topological-qubit coherence times. These pre-braiding experiments can be adapted to other manipulation and readout schemes as well.\n        "
 '\n        We explicitly derive the duality between a free electronic Dirac cone and quantum electrodynamics in $(2+1)$ dimensions (QED$_3$) with $N = 1$ fermion flavors. The duality proceeds via an exact, non-local mapping from electrons to dual fermions with long-range interactions encoded by an emergent gauge field. This mapping allows us to construct parent Hamiltonians for exotic topological-insulator surface phases, derive the particle-hole-symmetric field theory of a half-filled Landau level, and nontrivially constrain QED$_3$ scaling dimensions. We similarly establish duality between bosonic topological insulator surfaces and $N = 2$ QED$_3$.\n        '
 '\n        We show that boundaries of 3D weak topological insulators can become gapped by strong interactions while preserving all symmetries, leading to Abelian surface topological order. The anomalous nature of the weak topological insulators manifests itself in a non-trivial action of symmetries on the quasiparticles; most strikingly, translations change the anyon types in a manner impossible in strictly 2D systems with the same symmetry. As a further consequence, screw dislocations form non-Abelian defects that trap $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ parafermion zero modes.\n        '
 '\n        We concisely review the recent evolution in the study of parafermions -- exotic emergent excitations that generalize Majorana fermions and similarly underpin a host of novel phenomena. First we illustrate the intimate connection between Z_3-symmetric "spin" chains and one-dimensional parafermion lattice models, highlighting how the latter host a topological phase featuring protected edge zero modes. We then tour several blueprints for the laboratory realization of parafermion zero modes -- focusing on quantum Hall/superconductor hybrids, quantum Hall bilayers, and two-dimensional topological insulators -- and describe striking experimental fingerprints that they provide. Finally, we discuss how coupled parafermion arrays in quantum Hall architectures yield topological phases that potentially furnish hardware for a universal, intrinsically decoherence-free quantum computer.\n        '
 '\n        Recent concrete proposals suggest it is possible to engineer a two-dimensional bulk phase supporting non-Abelian Fibonacci anyons out of Abelian fractional quantum Hall systems. The low-energy degrees of freedom of such setups can be modeled as $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermions "hopping" on a two-dimensional lattice. We use the density matrix renormalization group to study a model of this type interpolating between the decoupled-chain, triangular-lattice, and square-lattice limits. The results show clear evidence of the Fibonacci phase over a wide region of the phase diagram, most notably including the isotropic triangular lattice point. We also study the broader phase diagram of this model and show that elsewhere it supports an Abelian state with semionic excitations.\n        '
 "\n        We introduce exotic gapless states---`composite Dirac liquids'---that can appear at a strongly interacting surface of a three-dimensional electronic topological insulator. Composite Dirac liquids exhibit a gap to all charge excitations but nevertheless feature a single massless Dirac cone built from emergent electrically neutral fermions. These states thus comprise electrical insulators that, interestingly, retain thermal properties similar to those of the non-interacting topological insulator surface. A variety of novel fully gapped phases naturally descend from composite Dirac liquids. Most remarkably, we show that gapping the neutral fermions via Cooper pairing---which crucially does not violate charge conservation---yields symmetric non-Abelian topologically ordered surface phases captured in several recent works. Other (Abelian) topological orders emerge upon alternatively gapping the neutral Dirac cone with magnetism. We establish a hierarchical relationship between these descendant phases and expose an appealing connection to paired states of composite Fermi liquids arising in the half-filled Landau level of two-dimensional electron gases. To controllably access these states we exploit a quasi-1D deformation of the original electronic Dirac cone that enables us to analytically address the fate of the strongly interacting surface. The algorithm we develop applies quite broadly and further allows the construction of symmetric surface topological orders for recently introduced bosonic topological insulators.\n        "
 "\n        The emergence of non-Abelian anyons from large collections of interacting elementary particles is a conceptually beautiful phenomenon with important ramifications for fault-tolerant quantum computing. Over the last few decades the field has evolved from a highly theoretical subject to an active experimental area, particularly following proposals for trapping non-Abelian anyons in `engineered' structures built from well-understood components. In this short overview we briefly tour the impressive progress that has taken place in the quest for the simplest type of non-Abelian anyon---defects binding Majorana zero modes---and then turn to similar strategies for pursuing more exotic excitations. Specifically, we describe how interfacing simple quantum Hall systems with conventional superconductors yields `parafermionic' generalizations of Majorana modes and even Fibonacci anyons---the latter enabling fully fault tolerant universal quantum computation. We structure our treatment in a manner that unifies these topics in a coherent way. The ideas synthesized here spotlight largely uncharted experimental territory in the field of quantum Hall physics that appears ripe for discovery.\n        "
 "\n        One-dimensional topological phases can host localized zero-energy modes that enable high-fidelity storage and manipulation of quantum information. Majorana fermion chains support a classic example of such a phase, having zero modes that guarantee two-fold degeneracy in all eigenstates up to exponentially small finite-size corrections. Chains of `parafermions'---generalized Majorana fermions---also support localized zero modes, but, curiously, only under much more restricted circumstances. We shed light on the enigmatic zero mode stability in parafermion chains by analytically and numerically studying the spectrum and developing an intuitive physical picture in terms of domain-wall dynamics. Specifically, we show that even if the system resides in a gapped topological phase with an exponentially accurate ground-state degeneracy, higher-energy states can exhibit a splitting that scales as a power law with system size---categorically ruling out exact localized zero modes. The transition to power-law behavior is described by critical behavior appearing exclusively within excited states.\n        "
 "\n        Spin liquids represent exotic types of quantum matter that evade conventional symmetry-breaking order even at zero temperature. Exhaustive classifications of spin liquids have been carried out in several systems, particularly in the presence of full SU(2) spin-rotation symmetry. Real magnetic compounds, however, generically break SU(2) spin symmetry as a result of spin-orbit coupling - which in many materials provides an `order one' effect. We generalize previous works by using the projective symmetry group method to classify $Z_2$ spin liquids on the square lattice when SU(2) spin symmetry is maximally lifted. We find that, counterintuitively, the lifting of spin symmetry actually results in vastly more spin liquid phases compared to SU(2)-invariant systems. A generic feature of the SU(2)-broken case is that the spinons naturally undergo $p+ip$ pairing; consequently, many of these $Z_2$ spin liquids feature a topologically nontrivial spinon band structure supporting gapless Majorana edge states. We study in detail several spin-liquid phases with varying numbers of gapless edge states and discuss their topological protection. The edge states are often protected by a combination of time reversal and lattice symmetries and hence resemble recently proposed topological crystalline superconductors.\n        "
 "\n        Finding the precise correspondence between lattice operators and the continuum fields that describe their long-distance properties is a largely open problem for strongly interacting critical points. Here we solve this problem essentially completely in the case of the three-state Potts model, which exhibits a phase transition described by a strongly interacting 'parafermion' conformal field theory. Using symmetry arguments, insights from integrability, and extensive simulations, we construct lattice analogues of nearly all the relevant and marginal physical fields governing this transition. This construction includes chiral fields such as the parafermion. Along the way we also clarify the structure of operator product expansions between order and disorder fields, which we confirm numerically. Our results both suggest a systematic methodology for attacking non-free field theories on the lattice and find broader applications in the pursuit of exotic topologically ordered phases of matter.\n        "
 "\n        Quantum spin Hall-superconductor hybrids are promising sources of topological superconductivity and Majorana modes, particularly given recent progress on HgTe and InAs/GaSb. We propose a new method of revealing topological superconductivity in extended quantum spin Hall Josephson junctions supporting `fractional Josephson currents'. Specifically, we show that as one threads magnetic flux between the superconductors, the critical current traces an interference pattern featuring sharp fingerprints of topological superconductivity---even when noise spoils parity conservation.\n        "
 "\n        Heterostructures formed by quantum Hall systems and superconductors have recently been shown to support widely coveted Majorana fermion zero-modes and still more exotic `parafermionic' generalizations. Here we establish that probing such zero-modes using quantum Hall edge states yields non-local transport signatures that pave the way towards a variety of novel circuit elements. In particular, we demonstrate quite generally that at low energies the zero-modes convert chirally moving quasiparticles into oppositely charged quasiholes propagating in the same direction---that is, they swap the sign of the chiral edge currents. One may then construct new and potentially useful circuit elements using this `perfect Andreev conversion' process, including superconducting current and voltage mirrors as well as transistors for fractional charge currents. Characterization of these circuit elements should provide striking evidence of the zero-mode physics.\n        "
 "\n        Non-Abelian anyons promise to reveal spectacular features of quantum mechanics that could ultimately provide the foundation for a decoherence-free quantum computer. A key breakthrough in the pursuit of these exotic particles originated from Read and Green's observation that the Moore-Read quantum Hall state and a (relatively simple) two-dimensional p+ip superconductor both support so-called Ising non-Abelian anyons. Here we establish a similar correspondence between the Z_3 Read-Rezayi quantum Hall state and a novel two-dimensional superconductor in which charge-2e Cooper pairs are built from fractionalized quasiparticles. In particular, both phases harbor Fibonacci anyons that---unlike Ising anyons---allow for universal topological quantum computation solely through braiding. Using a variant of Teo and Kane's construction of non-Abelian phases from weakly coupled chains, we provide a blueprint for such a superconductor using Abelian quantum Hall states interlaced with an array of superconducting islands. Fibonacci anyons appear as neutral deconfined particles that lead to a two-fold ground-state degeneracy on a torus. In contrast to a p+ip superconductor, vortices do not yield additional particle types yet depending on non-universal energetics can serve as a trap for Fibonacci anyons. These results imply that one can, in principle, combine well-understood and widely available phases of matter to realize non-Abelian anyons with universal braid statistics. Numerous future directions are discussed, including speculations on alternative realizations with fewer experimental requirements.\n        "
 "\n        A prominent signature of Majorana bound states is the exotic Josephson effects they produce, the classic example being a fractional Josephson current with 4πperiodicity in the phase difference across the junction. Recent work established that topological insulator edges support a novel `magneto-Josephson effect', whereby a dissipationless current exhibits 4π-periodic dependence also on the relative orientation of the Zeeman fields in the two banks of the junction. Here, we explore the magneto-Josephson effect in junctions based on spin-orbit coupled quantum wires. In contrast to the topological insulator case, the periodicities of the magneto-Josephson effect no longer follow from an exact superconductor-magnetism duality of the Hamiltonian. We employ numerical calculations as well as analytical arguments to identify the domain configurations that display exotic Josephson physics for quantum-wire junctions, and elucidate the characteristic differences with the corresponding setups for topological insulators edges. To provide guidance to experiments, we also estimate the magnitude of the magneto-Josephson effects in realistic parameter regimes, and compare the Majorana-related contribution to the coexisting 2π-periodic effects emerging from non-Majorana states.\n        "
 '\n        We introduce a promising new platform for Majorana zero-modes and various spintronics applications based on gate-defined wires in HgTe quantum wells. Due to the Dirac-like band structure for HgTe the physics of such systems differs markedly from that of conventional quantum wires. Most strikingly, we show that the subband parameters for gate-defined HgTe wires exhibit exquisite tunability: modest gate voltage variation allows one to modulate the Rashba spin-orbit energies from zero up to ~30K, and the effective g-factors from zero up to giant values exceeding 600. The large achievable spin-orbit coupling and g-factors together allow one to access Majorana modes in this setting at exceptionally low magnetic fields while maintaining robustness against disorder. As an additional benefit, gate-defined wires (in HgTe or other settings) should greatly facilitate the fabrication of networks for refined transport experiments used to detect Majoranas, as well as the realization of non-Abelian statistics and quantum information devices.\n        '
 '\n        Two-dimensional topological insulators (2D TIs) have been proposed as platforms for many intriguing applications, ranging from spintronics to topological quantum information processing. Realizing this potential will likely be facilitated by the discovery of new, easily manufactured materials in this class. With this goal in mind we introduce a new framework for engineering a 2D TI by hybridizing graphene with impurity bands arising from heavy adatoms possessing partially filled d-shells, in particular osmium and iridium. First principles calculations predict that the gaps generated by this means exceed 0.2 eV over a broad range of adatom coverage; moreover, tuning of the Fermi level is not required to enter the TI state. The mechanism at work is expected to be rather general and may open the door to designing new TI phases in many materials.\n        '
 "\n        We investigate 1D quantum systems that support Majorana bound states at interfaces between topologically distinct regions. In particular, we show that there exists a duality between particle-hole and spin degrees of freedom in certain spin-orbit-coupled 1D platforms such as topological insulator edges. This duality results in a spin analogue of previously explored `fractional Josephson effects'---that is, the spin current flowing across a magnetic junction exhibits 4π-periodicity in the relative magnetic field angle across the junction. Furthermore, the interplay between the particle-hole and spin degrees of freedom results in unconventional magneto-Josephson effects, such that the Josephson current is a function of the magnetic field orientation with periodicity 4π.\n        "
 '\n        We show that a topological phase supporting Majorana fermions can form in a 2D electron gas (2DEG) adjacent to an interdigitated superconductor-ferromagnet structure. An advantage of this setup is that the 2DEG can induce the required Zeeman splitting and superconductivity from a single interface, allowing one to utilize a wide class of 2DEGs including the surface states of bulk InAs. We demonstrate that the interdigitated device supports a robust topological phase when the finger spacing lambda is smaller than half of the Fermi wavelength lambda_F. In this regime, the electrons effectively see a "smeared" Zeeman splitting and pairing field despite the interdigitation. The topological phase survives even in the opposite limit lambda>lambda_F/2, though with a reduced bulk gap. We describe how to electrically generate a vortex in this setup to trap a Majorana mode, and predict an anomalous Fraunhofer pattern that provides a sharp signature of chiral Majorana edge states.\n        '
 "\n        Non-Abelian anyons--particles whose exchange noncommutatively transforms a system's quantum state--are widely sought for the exotic fundamental physics they harbor as well as for quantum computing applications. There now exist numerous blueprints for stabilizing the simplest type of non-Abelian anyon, defects binding Majorana modes, by judiciously interfacing widely available materials. Following this line of attack, we introduce a device fabricated from conventional fractional quantum Hall states and s-wave superconductors that supports exotic non-Abelian anyons that bind `parafermions', which can be viewed as fractionalized Majorana fermions. We show that these modes can be experimentally identified (and distinguished from Majoranas) using Josephson measurements. We also provide a practical recipe for braiding parafermions and show that they give rise to non-Abelian statistics. Interestingly, braiding in our setup produces a richer set of topologically protected qubit operations when compared to the Majorana case. As a byproduct, we establish a new, experimentally realistic Majorana platform in weakly spin-orbit-coupled materials such as GaAs.\n        "
 "\n        One of the most promising proposals for engineering topological superconductivity and Majorana fermions employs a spin-orbit coupled nanowire subjected to a magnetic field and proximate to an s-wave superconductor. When only part of the wire's length contacts to the superconductor, the remaining conducting portion serves as a natural lead that can be used to probe these Majorana modes via tunneling. The enhanced role of interactions in one dimension dictates that this configuration should be viewed as a superconductor-Luttinger liquid junction. We investigate such junctions between both helical and spinful Luttinger liquids, and topological as well as non-topological superconductors. We determine the phase diagram for each case and show that universal low-energy transport in these systems is governed by fixed points describing either perfect normal reflection or perfect Andreev reflection. In addition to capturing (in some instances) the familiar Majorana-mediated `zero-bias anomaly' in a new framework, we show that interactions yield dramatic consequences in certain regimes. Indeed, we establish that strong repulsion removes this conductance anomaly altogether while strong attraction produces dynamically generated effective Majorana modes even in a junction with a trivial superconductor. Interactions further lead to striking signatures in the local density of states and the line-shape of the conductance peak at finite voltage, and also are essential for establishing smoking-gun transport signatures of Majorana fermions in spinful Luttinger liquid junctions.\n        "
 "\n        The 1937 theoretical discovery of Majorana fermions--whose defining property is that they are their own anti-particles--has since impacted diverse problems ranging from neutrino physics and dark matter searches to the fractional quantum Hall effect and superconductivity. Despite this long history the unambiguous observation of Majorana fermions nevertheless remains an outstanding goal. This review article highlights recent advances in the condensed matter search for Majorana that have led many in the field to believe that this quest may soon bear fruit. We begin by introducing in some detail exotic `topological' one- and two-dimensional superconductors that support Majorana fermions at their boundaries and at vortices. We then turn to one of the key insights that arose during the past few years; namely, that it is possible to `engineer' such exotic superconductors in the laboratory by forming appropriate heterostructures with ordinary s-wave superconductors. Numerous proposals of this type are discussed, based on diverse materials such as topological insulators, conventional semiconductors, ferromagnetic metals, and many others. The all-important question of how one experimentally detects Majorana fermions in these setups is then addressed. We focus on three classes of measurements that provide smoking-gun Majorana signatures: tunneling, Josephson effects, and interferometry. Finally, we discuss the most remarkable properties of condensed matter Majorana fermions--the non-Abelian exchange statistics that they generate and their associated potential for quantum computation.\n        "
 '\n        It has been proposed that localized zero-energy Majorana states can be realized in a two-dimensional network of quasi-one-dimensional semiconductor wires that are proximity-coupled to a bulk superconductor. The wires should have strong spin-orbit coupling with appropriate symmetry, and their electrons should be partially polarized by a strong Zeeman field. Then, if the Fermi level is in an appropriate range, the wire can be in a topological superconducting phase, with Majorana states that occur at wire ends and at $Y$ junctions, where three topological superconductor segments may be joined. Here we generalize these ideas to consider a three-dimensional network. The positions of Majorana states can be manipulated, and their non-Abelian properties made visible, by using external gates to selectively deplete portions of the network, or by physically connecting and redividing wire segments. Majorana states can also be manipulated by reorientations of the Zeeman field on a wire segment, by physically rotating the wire about almost any axis, or by evolution of the phase of the order parameter in the proximity-coupled superconductor. We show how to keep track of sign changes in the zero-energy Hilbert space during adiabatic manipulations by monitoring the evolution of each Majorana state separately, rather than keeping track of the braiding of all possible pairs. This has conceptual advantages in the case of a three-dimensional network, and may be computationally useful even in two dimensions, if large numbers of Majorana sites are involved.\n        '
 '\n        Topological insulator edges and spin-orbit-coupled quantum wires in proximity to s-wave super- conductors can be tuned through a topological quantum phase transition by a Zeeman field. Here we show that a supercurrent flowing in the s-wave superconductor also drives such a transition. We propose to use this new mechanism to generate and manipulate Majorana fermions that localize at domain walls between topological and nontopological regions of an edge or wire. In quantum wires, this method carries the added benefit that a supercurrent reduces the critical Zeeman field at which the topological phase appears.\n        '
 "\n        A junction between two topological superconductors containing a pair of Majorana fermions exhibits a `fractional' Josephson effect, $4π$ periodic in the superconductors' phase difference. An additional fractional Josephson effect, however, arises when the Majoranas are spatially separated by a superconducting barrier. This new term gives rise to a set of Shapiro steps which are essentially absent without Majorana modes and therefore provides a unique signature for these exotic states.\n        "
 "\n        Recent experiments on the anisotropic spin-1/2 triangular antiferromagnet Cs_2CuBr_4 have revealed a remarkably rich phase diagram in applied magnetic fields, consisting of an unexpectedly large number of ordered phases. Motivated by this finding, we study the role of spatial anisotropy, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, and quantum fluctuations on the magnetization process of a triangular antiferromagnet, coming from the semiclassical limit. The richness of the problem stems from two key facts: 1) the classical isotropic model exhibits a large accidental ground state degeneracy, and 2) these three ingredients compete with one another and split this degeneracy in opposing ways. Using a variety of complementary approaches, including extensive Monte Carlo numerics, spin-wave theory, and an analysis of Bose-Einstein condensation of magnons at high fields, we find that their interplay gives rise to a complex phase diagram consisting of numerous incommensurate and commensurate phases. Our results shed light on the observed phase diagram for Cs_2CuBr_4 and suggest a number of future theoretical and experimental directions that will be useful for obtaining a complete understanding of this material's interesting phenomenology.\n        "
 '\n        Among the broad spectrum of systems predicted to exhibit topological superconductivity and Majorana fermions, one-dimensional wires with strong spin-orbit coupling provide one of the most promising experimental candidates. Here we investigate the fate of the topological superconducting phase in such wires when repulsive interactions are present. Using a combination of Density Matrix Renormalization Group, bosonization, and Hartree-Fock techniques, we demonstrate that while interactions degrade the bulk gap -consistent with recent results of Gangadharaiah et al.- they also greatly expand the parameter range over which the topological phase arises. In particular, we show that with interactions this phase can be accessed over a broader chemical potential window, thereby leading to greater immunity against disorder-induced chemical potential fluctuations in the wire. We also suggest that in certain wires strong interactions may allow Majorana fermions to be generated without requiring a magnetic field.\n        '
 '\n        The 2007 discovery of quantized conductance in HgTe quantum wells delivered the field of topological insulators (TIs) its first experimental confirmation. While many three-dimensional TIs have since been identified, HgTe remains the only known two-dimensional system in this class. Difficulty fabricating HgTe quantum wells has, moreover, hampered their widespread use. With the goal of breaking this logjam we provide a blueprint for stabilizing a robust TI state in a more readily available two-dimensional material---graphene. Using symmetry arguments, density functional theory, and tight-binding simulations, we predict that graphene endowed with certain heavy adatoms realizes a TI with substantial band gap. For indium and thallium, our most promising adatom candidates, a modest 6% coverage produces an estimated gap near 80K and 240K, respectively, which should be detectable in transport or spectroscopic measurements. Engineering such a robust topological phase in graphene could pave the way for a new generation of devices for spintronics, ultra-low-dissipation electronics and quantum information processing.\n        '
 '\n        We consider the effects of local impurities in highly frustrated diamond lattice antiferromagnets, which exhibit large but non-extensive ground state degeneracies. Such models are appropriate to many A-site magnetic spinels. We argue very generally that sufficiently dilute impurities induce an ordered magnetic ground state, and provide a mechanism of degeneracy breaking. The states which are selected can be determined by a "swiss cheese model" analysis, which we demonstrate numerically for a particular impurity model in this case. Moreover, we present criteria for estimating the stability of the resulting ordered phase to a competing frozen (spin glass) one. The results may explain the contrasting finding of frozen and ordered ground states in CoAl2O4 and MnSc2S4, respectively.\n        '

In our proposed setup, two internal states of the atoms couple via an optical Raman transition---simultaneously inducing an effective spin-orbit interaction and magnetic field---while a background molecular BEC cloud generates s-wave pairing for the atoms. The resulting cold atom quantum wire supports Majorana fermions at phase boundaries between topologically trivial and nontrivial regions, as well as `Floquet Majorana fermions' when the system is periodically driven. We analyze experimental parameters, detection schemes, and various imperfections.\n        "
 '\n        Topological quantum computation provides an elegant way around decoherence, as one encodes quantum information in a non-local fashion that the environment finds difficult to corrupt. Here we establish that one of the key operations---braiding of non-Abelian anyons---can be implemented in one-dimensional semiconductor wire networks. Previous work [Lutchyn et al., arXiv:1002.4033 and Oreg et al., arXiv:1003.1145] provided a recipe for driving semiconducting wires into a topological phase supporting long-sought particles known as Majorana fermions that can store topologically protected quantum information. Majorana fermions in this setting can be transported, created, and fused by applying locally tunable gates to the wire. More importantly, we show that networks of such wires allow braiding of Majorana fermions and that they exhibit non-Abelian statistics like vortices in a p+ip superconductor. We propose experimental setups that enable the Majorana fusion rules to be probed, along with networks that allow for efficient exchange of arbitrary numbers of Majorana fermions. This work paves a new path forward in topological quantum computation that benefits from physical transparency and experimental realism.\n        '
 '\n          The experimental realization of Majorana fermions presents an important problem due to their non-Abelian nature and potential exploitation for topological quantum computation. Very recently Sau et al. [arXiv:0907.2239] demonstrated that a topological superconducting phase supporting Majorana fermions can be realized using surprisingly conventional building blocks: a semiconductor quantum well coupled to an s-wave superconductor and a ferromagnetic insulator. Here we propose an alternative setup, wherein a topological superconducting phase is driven by applying an in-plane magnetic field to a (110)-grown semiconductor coupled only to an s-wave superconductor. This device offers a number of advantages, notably a simpler architecture and the ability to tune across a quantum phase transition into the topological superconducting state, while still largely avoiding unwanted orbital effects. Experimental feasibility of both setups is discussed in some detail.\n        '
 "\n          Composite fermions have played a seminal role in understanding the quantum Hall effect, particularly the formation of a compressible `composite Fermi liquid' (CFL) at filling factor nu = 1/2. Here we suggest that in multi-layer systems interlayer Coulomb repulsion can similarly generate `metallic' behavior of composite fermions between layers, even if the electrons remain insulating. Specifically, we propose that a quantum Hall bilayer with nu = 1/2 per layer at intermediate layer separation may host such an interlayer coherent CFL, driven by exciton condensation of composite fermions. This phase has a number of remarkable properties: the presence of `bonding' and `antibonding' composite Fermi seas, compressible behavior with respect to symmetric currents, and fractional quantum Hall behavior in the counterflow channel. Quantum oscillations associated with the Fermi seas give rise to a new series of incompressible states at fillings nu = p/[2(p \\pm 1)] per layer (p an integer), which is a bilayer analogue of the Jain sequence.\n        "
 '\n          Recent experiments on bismuth have uncovered remarkably rich magnetization structure at fields well beyond the regime in which all carriers are expected to reside in the lowest Landau level. Motivated by these findings, we start from a microscopic tight-binding model and derive a low-energy Hamiltonian for the holes and three Dirac electrons pockets in bismuth. We find that an unconventional electron Zeeman effect, overlooked previously, suppresses the quantum limit for the electrons dramatically, giving rise to the observed anomalous magnetization structure. We further study interaction effects near fields at which the 2nd Landau level for one electron pocket empties, where magnetization hysteresis was observed. Here we find instabilities towards both charge density wave and Wigner crystal phases, and propose that hysteresis arises from a first-order transition out of the latter.\n        '
 '\n          We consider the phase diagram of a spatially anisotropic 2D triangular antiferromagnet in a magnetic field. Classically, the ground state is umbrella-like for all fields, but we show that the quantum phase diagram is much richer and contains a 1/3 magnetization plateau, two commensurate planar states, two incommensurate chiral umbrella phases, and, possibly, a planar state separating the two chiral phases. Our analysis sheds light on several recent experimental findings for the spin-1/2 system Cs_2CuBr_4.\n        '
 '\n          The phenomenon of gene conservation is an interesting evolutionary problem related to speciation and adaptation. Conserved genes are acted upon in evolution in a way that preserves their function despite other structural and functional changes going on around them. The recent availability of whole-genomic data from closely related species allows us to test the hypothesis that a core genome present in a hypothetical common ancestor is inherited by all sister taxa. Furthermore, this core genome should serve essential functions such as genetic regulation and cellular repair. Whole-genome sequences from three strains of bacteria (Shewanella sp.) were used in this analysis. The open reading frames (ORFs) for each identified and putative gene were used for each genome. Reciprocal Blast searches were conducted on all three genomes, which distilled a list of thousands of genes to 68 genes that were identical across taxa. Based on functional annotation, these genes were identified as housekeeping genes, which confirmed the original hypothesis. This method could be used in eukaryotes as well, in particular the relationship between humans, chimps, and macaques.\n        '
 "\n          Algebraic spin liquids, which are exotic gapless spin states preserving all microscopic symmetries, have been widely studied due to potential realizations in frustrated quantum magnets and the cuprates. At low energies, such putative phases are described by quantum electrodynamics in 2+1 dimensions. While significant progress has been made in understanding this nontrivial interacting field theory and the associated spin physics, one important issue which has proved elusive is the quantum numbers carried by so-called monopole operators. Here we address this issue in the ``staggered-flux'' spin liquid which may be relevant to the pseudogap regime in high-T_c. Employing general analytical arguments supported by simple numerics, we argue that proximate phases encoded in the monopole operators include the familiar Neel and valence bond solid orders, as well as other symmetry-breaking orders closely related to those previously explored in the monopole-free sector of the theory. Surprisingly, we also find that one monopole operator carries trivial quantum numbers, and briefly discuss its possible implications.\n        "
 "\n          Graphene's honeycomb lattice structure underlies much of the remarkable physics inherent in this material, most strikingly through the formation of two ``flavors'' of Dirac cones for each spin. In the quantum Hall regime, the resulting flavor degree of freedom leads to an interesting problem when a Landau level is partially occupied. Namely, while Zeeman splitting clearly favors polarizing spins along the field, precisely how the states for each flavor are occupied can become quite delicate. Here we focus on clean graphene sheets in the regime of quantum Hall ferromagnetism, and discuss how subtler lattice-scale physics, arising either from interactions or disorder, resolves this ambiguity to measurable consequence. Interestingly, such lattice-scale physics favors microscopic symmetry-breaking order coexisting with the usual liquid-like quantum Hall physics emerging on long length scales. The current experimental situation is briefly reviewed in light of our discussion.\n        "
 "\n          There is growing evidence from both experiment and numerical studies that low half-odd integer quantum spins on a kagome lattice with predominant antiferromagnetic near neighbor interactions do not order magnetically or break lattice symmetries even at temperatures much lower than the exchange interaction strength. Moreover, there appear to be a plethora of low energy excitations, predominantly singlets but also spin carrying, which suggest that the putative underlying quantum spin liquid is a gapless ``critical spin liquid'' rather than a gapped spin liquid with topological order. Here, we develop an effective field theory approach for the spin-1/2 Heisenberg model with easy-plane anisotropy on the kagome lattice. By employing a vortex duality transformation, followed by a fermionization and flux-smearing, we obtain access to a gapless yet stable critical spin liquid phase, which is described by (2+1)-dimensional quantum electrodynamics (QED$_3$) with an emergent $\\mathrm{SU}(8)$ flavor symmetry. The specific heat, thermal conductivity, and dynamical structure factor are extracted from the effective field theory, and contrasted with other theoretical approaches to the kagome antiferromagnet.\n        "
 "\n          Frustration refers to competition between different interactions that cannot be simultaneously satisfied, a familiar feature in many magnetic solids. Strong frustration results in highly degenerate ground states, and a large suppression of ordering by fluctuations. Key challenges in frustrated magnetism are characterizing the fluctuating spin-liquid regime and determining the mechanism of eventual order at lower temperature. Here, we study a model of a diamond lattice antiferromagnet appropriate for numerous spinel materials. With sufficiently strong frustration a massive ground state degeneracy develops amongst spirals whose propagation wavevectors reside on a continuous two-dimensional ``spiral surface'' in momentum space. We argue that an important ordering mechanism is entropic splitting of the degenerate ground states, an elusive phenomena called order-by-disorder. A broad ``spiral spin-liquid'' regime emerges at higher temperatures, where the underlying spiral surface can be directly revealed via spin correlations. We discuss the agreement between these predictions and the well characterized spinel MnSc2S4.\n        "
 "\n          Although magnetically ordered at low temperatures, the spin-1/2 triangular antiferromagnet Cs_2CuCl_4 exhibits remarkable spin dynamics that strongly suggest proximity to a spin liquid phase. Here we address the question of whether a proximate spin liquid may also occur in an applied magnetic field, leaving a similar imprint on the dynamical spin correlations of this material. Specifically, we explore a spatially anisotropic Heisenberg spin-1/2 triangular antiferromagnet at 1/3 magnetization from a dual vortex perspective, and indeed find a new ``critical'' spin liquid phase described by QED3 with an emergent SU(6) symmetry. A number of nontrivial predictions are given for the dynamical spin structure factor in this ``algebraic vortex liquid'' phase, which can be tested experimentally via inelastic neutron scattering. We also discuss how the well-studied ``up-up-down'' magnetization plateaus can be captured within our approach, and further predict the existence of a stable gapless solid phase in a weakly ordered up-up-down state. Finally, we predict several anomalous ``roton'' minima in the excitation spectrum in the regime of lattice anisotropy where the canted Neel state appears.\n        "
 '\n          Starting from the graphene lattice tight-binding Hamiltonian with an on-site U and long-range Coulomb repulsion, we derive an interacting continuum Dirac theory governing the low-energy behavior of graphene in an applied magnetic field. Initially, we consider a clean graphene system within this effective theory and explore integer quantum Hall ferromagnetism stabilized by exchange from the long-range Coulomb repulsion. We study in detail the ground state and excitations at nu = 0 and nu = \\pm 1, taking into account small symmetry-breaking terms that arise from the lattice-scale interactions, and also explore the ground states selected at nu = \\pm 3, \\pm 4, and \\pm 5. We argue that the ferromagnetic regime may not yet be realized in current experimental samples, which at the above filling factors perhaps remain paramagnetic due to strong disorder. In an attempt to access the latter regime where the role of exchange is strongly suppressed by disorder, we apply Hartree theory to study the effects of interactions. Here, we find that Zeeman splitting together with symmetry-breaking interactions can in principle produce integer quantum Hall states in a paramagnetic system at nu = 0, \\pm 1 and \\pm 4, but not at nu = \\pm 3 or \\pm 5, consistent with recent experiments in high magnetic fields. We make predictions for the activation energies in these quantum Hall states which will be useful for determining their true origin.\n        '
 "\n          We explore spin-1/2 triangular antiferromagnets with both easy-plane and lattice exchange anisotropies by employing a dual vortex mapping followed by a fermionization of the vortices. Over a broad range of exchange anisotropy, this approach leads naturally to a ``critical'' spin liquid--the algebraic vortex liquid--which appears to be distinct from other known spin liquids. We present a detailed characterization of this state, which is described in terms of non-compact QED3 with an emergent SU(4) symmetry. Descendant phases of the algebraic vortex liquid are also explored, which include the Kalmeyer-Laughlin spin liquid, a variety of magnetically ordered states such as the well known coplanar spiral state, and supersolids. In the range of exchange anisotropy where the ``square lattice'' Neel ground state arises, we demonstrate that anomalous ``roton'' minima in the excitation spectrum recently reported in series expansions can be accounted for within our approach.\n        "
 '\n          Motivated by inelastic neutron scattering data on Cs_2CuCl_4, we explore spin-1/2 triangular lattice antiferromagnets with both spatial and easy-plane exchange anisotropies, the latter due to an observed Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Exploiting a duality mapping followed by a fermionization of the dual vortex degrees of freedom, we find a novel "critical" spin-liquid phase described in terms of Dirac fermions with an emergent global SU(4) symmetry minimally coupled to a non-compact U(1) gauge field. This ``algebraic vortex liquid" supports gapless spin excitations and universal power-law correlations in the dynamical spin structure factor which are consistent with those observed in Cs_2CuCl_4. We suggest future neutron scattering experiments that should help distinguish between the algebraic vortex liquid and other spin liquids and quantum critical points previously proposed in the context of Cs_2CuCl_4.\n        '
 '\n          We revisit two-dimensional frustrated quantum magnetism from a new perspective, with the aim of exploring new critical points and critical phases. We study easy-plane triangular antiferromagnets using a dual vortex approach, fermionizing the vortices with a Chern-Simons field. Herein we develop this technique for integer-spin systems which generically exhibit a simple paramagnetic phase as well as magnetically-ordered phases with coplanar and collinear spin order. Within the fermionized-vortex approach, we derive a low-energy effective theory containing Dirac fermions with two flavors minimally coupled to a U(1) and a Chern-Simons gauge field. At criticality we argue that the Chern-Simons gauge field can be subsumed into the U(1) gauge field, and up to irrelevant interactions one arrives at quantum electrodynamics in (2+1) dimensions (QED3). Moreover, we conjecture that critical QED3 with full SU(2) flavor symmetry describes the O(4) multicritical point of the spin model where the paramagnet and two magnetically-ordered phases merge. The remarkable implication is that QED3 with flavor SU(2) symmetry is dual to ordinary critical Phi^4 field theory with O(4) symmetry. This leads to a number of unexpected, verifiable predictions for QED3. A connection of our fermionized-vortex approach with the dipole interpretation of the nu=1/2 fractional quantum Hall state is also demonstrated. The approach introduced in this paper will be applied to spin-1/2 systems in a forthcoming publication.\n        '
 "\n          High-mobility 2D electron systems in a perpendicular magnetic field exhibit zero resistance states (ZRS) when driven with microwave radiation. We study the nonequilibrium phase transition into this ZRS using phenomenological equations of motion to describe the current and density fluctuations. We focus on two models for the transition into a time-independent steady state. Model-I assumes rotational invariance, density conservation, and symmetry under shifting the density globally by a constant. This model is argued to describe physics on small length scales where the density does not vary appreciably from its mean. The ordered state that arises in this case breaks rotational invariance and consists of a uniform current and transverse Hall field. We discuss some properties of this state, such as stability to fluctuations and the appearance of a Goldstone mode associated with the continuous symmetry breaking. Using dynamical renormalization group techniques, we find that with short-range interactions this model can admit a continuous transition described by mean-field theory, whereas with long-range interactions the transition is driven first-order. Model-II, which assumes only rotational invariance and density conservation and is argued to be appropriate on longer length scales, is shown to predict a first-order transition with either short- or long-range interactions. We discuss implications for experiments, including scaling relations and a possible way to detect the Goldstone mode in the case of a continuous transition into the ZRS, as well as possible signatures of a first-order transition in larger samples. We also point out the connection of our work to the well-studied phenomenon of `flocking'.\n        "
 '\n          The average charge Q on a quantum wire, modeled as a single-channel Luttinger liquid, connected to metallic leads and coupled to a gate is studied theoretically. We find that the behavior of the charge as the gate voltage V_G varies depends strongly on experimentally adjustable parameters (length, contact transmission, temperature,...). When the intrinsic backscattering at the contacts is weak (i.e. the conductance is close to 2e^2/h at high temperature), we predict that this behavior should be described by a universal function. For short such wires, the charge increases roughly linearly with V_G, with small oscillations due to quantum interference between electrons scattered at the contacts. For longer wires at low temperature, Coulomb blockade behavior sets in, and the charge increases in steps. In both limits $\\partial Q/\\partial V_G$, which should characterize the linear response conductance, exhibits periodic peaks in V_G. We show that due to Coulomb interactions the period in the former limit is twice that of the latter, and describe the evolution of the peaks through this crossover. The study can be generalized to multi-channel Luttinger liquids, and may explain qualitatively the recent observation by Liang et al (Phys. Rev. Lett. 88, 126801) of a four-electron periodicity for electron addition in single-walled carbon nanotubes.\n        '
 '\n          The resistance of multilayers with interface roughness on a length scale which is large compared to the atomic spacing is computed in several cases via the Boltzmann equation. This type of roughness is common in magnetic multilayers. When the electronic mean free paths are small compared to the layer thicknesses, the current flow is non-uniform, and the resistance decreases in the Current-Perpendicular-to-Plane (CPP) configuration and increases in the Current-In-Plane (CIP) configuration. For mean free paths much longer than the layer thicknesses, the current flow is uniform, and the resistance increases in both the CPP and CIP configurations due to enhanced surface scattering. In both the CPP and CIP geometries, the giant magnetoresistance can be either enhanced or reduced by the presence of long length scale interface roughness depending on the parameters. Finally, the changes in the CPP and CIP resistivities due to increasing interface roughness are estimated using experimentally determined parameters.\n        ']
